# Reporter-App

App was build using MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js). It allows to create simplified pentest reports - every report can be afterwards editied - it also contains list of vulnerabilities templates and their impact. Usage should be pretty self-explanatory. In modify report page - it is possible to add permanent vulnerability template - or vulnerability which will be added to report (every added vulnerability can be different from template of course). 

Please mantain ids for impact level as in example database dump ("_id": 1, "level" : "High", "_id": 2, "level" : "Medium", "_id": 3, "level" : "Low", "_id": 4, "level" : "Informational") as otherwise visuals could break.

## Requirements

Need Angular CLI and npm installed on target system.

## Build
Branch compiled contains already compiled angular sources in case of any problems. When pulling from master branch - first go to angular-src folder and type 'npm install' to install dependencies. Then type ng build to build compiled angular files. You can omit these steps if you pulled from compiled branch.

Next, got to main directory, type npm install to again install dependencies for Node.js project and afterwards run project with npm start. It should start listening on port 4444. By default it connects to MongoDB server on localhost:27017 with no credentials. If you want to connect to database configured differently, please change connection string in config/database.js.

## Database
In dump folder there is example that can be imported into mongodb base. It can be imported with mongorestore command. It needs to be placed into database called 'api'. Import command goes like this: 'mongorestore --db api <path/to/bson/file.bson>'.
